Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries by enabling machines to learn from data 
and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Machine Learning, a subset of AI, focuses on 
developing algorithms that allow systems to improve their performance automatically through experience. 
Applications of AI span across healthcare, finance, education, and autonomous systems, redefining the 
way humans interact with technology.
